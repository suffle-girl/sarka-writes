    title: "Ode to September",

    content: `
Sometimes I ache
for September to arrive
as vividly and clearly
as if it were
a long lost love
returning to the shores of our home
once in a century, or two.

Lost in long days
of the summer season,
seeking a refuge
from its sharp, sinking teeth,
like trying to escape
a crazed wolf dance
when the song of a hunt
vibrates through the pack’s old bones.

On the days of the heat,
I forget to live.
I seem to be forgetting
how to breathe, and laugh, too.
To dance. Oh, and to dream.

And when the rain finally comes,
only to tease me with the memory of you,
I do daydream.
About your sunny days lit with gold,
about the leaves
of changing color, oh please,
the spiderwebs drifting in wind,
your misty, cold mornings, apples, and trees,
and the spooky season
tracing our steps
and outstretching its fingertips
to cares our sleepy heads.

So come, come,
your time is nearly here,
and I am watching the horizon
every single day
to give you the welcome
you so desperately need.

If only
you could stay with me
forever.

Usually, when confronted with difficult situations, all she wanted to do was run away. Yet when it came to leaving, to saying goodbyes, to walking away, now, she was hesitant. It was moments like these which truly revealed how much good came from the problems she encountered, how far she grew in the process, how many wonderful people she had the privilege to meet.
She wanted to feel grateful for the past, hopeful for the future ahead of her, but decided to pause instead. As the sadness she felt was just as valid feeling as the rest of the bunch.

Have you ever wondered if there is
such a thing
as missing a place you’ve never been,
missing a place which
does not even exist?
Well, apparently
there is.

As you might know, there is this castle
sitting somewhere in the Scottish Highlands,
overlooking valley with a lake
and acres of the blackest, darkest forest
you could possibly imagine.
The castle has many towers, and hidden corners, hidden rooms
– reminding me so much of my beloved Prague –
so many secrets, and such a long history...
The walls here could talk
– and they probably will –
the gargoyles might scream,
and the ghosts of this place
will merrily whisper about everything you longed to know.

I spent my entire childhood within these walls,
running along the green slopes,
memorizing all alleys and corridors,
getting to know everyone who truly lived this dream...
And I was here
throughout my adult years as well.
Some years, I spent here much more time than I would like to admit,
and I feel like
my heart has never truly left the place
since I first saw it
on the silver screen
with my mum – my best friend –
by my side.
All that time before
my whole world had crumbled
and I had to start building it anew.

I guess it was always a way
to fill the void inside me,
which no matter how hard I try
will forever echo through my bones –
but that castle on the hill
feels, and smells, and tastes like home.
A home that will never stop its alluring song
to call me back to its loving embrace.
A home that was never there.
And never will.
Oh, how typical
of me.

She couldn’t not notice that with any kind of beauty she experienced in her life, there was always sadness too. She maybe didn’t understand why yet, but it was always there. Beauty made her feel like listening to classical music; it made her wonder about winged things, and flying too close to the sun.

As my Job-Hunting Story 2024 recently received an unexpected sequel 🎬, I am getting ready to make the most out of it this time around 🦄

Starring me, obviously as the protagonist👸🏻:
✅ a hard worker with great discipline, excellent language and communication skills in both Czech and English; 
✅ an organized, focused, all-nerdy-things loving woman with broad professional experience
⏩️ which will make me a great (𝗝𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿) 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁-𝗘𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿, 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗘𝗱𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿, 𝗖𝗼𝗽𝘆𝘄𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 / 𝗨𝗫 𝗪𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗲𝗿 or 𝗤𝗔 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿.

The other main character of the story will hopefully be this nice company💻 with:
🥉 good processes, 
🥈 well-established communication, 
🥇 and a healthy approach towards the work-life balance. 

I am looking for a company culture that will make me feel excited when I’m on my way to the office once or twice a week and a team in which we can inspire and support each other no matter the situation 👾

I will be grateful for any relevant tips or recommendations, especially if you know about a company which might be a good fit 🤝

I think about happiness a lot
lately.
About how life can be beautiful
when you least expect it,
about the things you are afraid might happen,
and when they do, it is the best thing that has
happened in a first place.

I think about people in my life,
and how extraordinary blessed I am
to have you all around.
You.
And you.
And you, too.
Oh, how rich I am in a universe
where riches are measured by great friends,
magical encounters,
minutes of genuine laughter,
and conversations one does not want to ever
leave behind.

I think about who I used to be,
and about who I will be,
never the same person I am today.
How impossible growth used to feel,
or change, for that matter,
and how trivial it seems
when you make it across the parapet.

I think about the dragons
swimming in my veins,
about the gorgeous, untamed, wild woman in me,
how she used to be,
diminished almost to mere ashes.
About phoenixes being reborn
from the fire
and dust,
from mere will to live,
and lust.

I think. A lot.
And I am.
Happy.

💡𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐢𝐠𝐢𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐀𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐲 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐤 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐠𝐚𝐯𝐞 💡

As there is still a week left before the gates to the next Digital Academy by Czechitas close, I’ve decided to share this two-part post about my experience in the nearly four-month course – should anyone needed a slight push ✋🤚

So, buckle up and let’s do this 💪

𝐏𝐀𝐑𝐓 𝟏: 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐀𝐜𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐦𝐲 𝐭𝐨𝐨𝐤 🥷
𝟏. 𝐀𝐥𝐦𝐨𝐬𝐭 𝐟𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐦𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐡𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐦𝐲 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞
The time commitment is quite obvious from a peak into the course’s schedule, but there were a few things I didn’t anticipate:
🔸First, that it’s gonna take up much more of my time than the mere lessons and events in the calendar.
🔹Second, that I will become super grateful for being unemployed for this part of my journey, as I will be able to spend entire days coding and programming.
🔸And third, I will truly enjoy spending my days like this.

𝟐. 𝐌𝐲 𝐧𝐚𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐛𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐞𝐟 𝐈 𝐰𝐢𝐥𝐥 𝐛𝐞 𝐚𝐛𝐥𝐞 𝐭𝐨 𝐟𝐢𝐧𝐝 𝐚 𝐣𝐨𝐛 𝐦𝐨𝐫𝐞 𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐥𝐲
The job market changes a lot, and it’s hard to determine which positions will be in hot demand in six months 🫣 It was a bit of a gamble, but looking back, I wouldn’t change the focus to any other academy.
🩷 Yes, it might take me a bit longer to find that entry job of my dreams, but at least it is once again something I really enjoy doing 💙

𝟑. 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐥𝐚𝐬𝐭 𝐫𝐞𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐬𝐞𝐥𝐟-𝐝𝐨𝐮𝐛𝐭𝐬
📜 Far away in the ancient past, I have tried studying Informatics at a collage, but failed tremendously because I thought you either have the talent (and know how to type curly braces right away), or you don’t. As if miraculously, I would start thinking like a programmer on the spot, or never 🫣
💡 If I have had someone by my side back then, someone who would encourage me to ask all the questions, to ask for help, and to remember everyone had to start somewhere at some point, I would have had at least some chances to succeed.
🩷 People at Czechitas among others have been this voice of reason for us in the last couple of months and it has been truly invaluable 💙

𝟒. 𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐟𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐭𝐨 𝐚𝐬𝐤 (𝐚𝐧𝐲) 𝐪𝐮𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬
Sometimes I feel the IT grew to be such a guys’ game that we girls are petrified to ask any question in fear to be branded, well, not exactly smart.
🩷 In Czechitas, the most important thing we heard over and over again was to never be afraid to ask any question, or even ask for some extra help. And repeated a thousand times in a span of four months, it starts to rewrite your DNA 💙

Were you in the academy too? What did it take away from you? 💬

The last time I closed a chapter
and headed for a new one,
I couldn’t wait.
I was so eager to run away,
to meet new people,
and forget old heartbreak…
Forget the new heartbreak of that time
as well.

And I did.
Through chaos and madness,
witnessing new friendships bloom
and die,
and bloom again,
through love, with time,
I started to forget.
I started to heal.
That was this chapter about all along…

But now I’m ready,
I have been told.
Even without trying,
the chapter reached its end.
The new one awaits.
Full of growth,
new friendships,
adventures,
and fulfilled dreams.
I’m sure.

The path leads forward,
the path is clear,
and I am
so incredibly grateful.
Yet my heart —
and my fears —
has me looking back.
As if the ending chapter was a place
I visited during early summer days
and it stole a piece of my soul
which I’m never getting back.
And I fear,
oh I fear,
that one day, I will forget this place
entirely.

Well, in the end,
it seems only a fair price.

He is
somewhere
out there.
Probably doing things
scary demons usually do.
I’m yearning to see him,
day by day. And night. By night…
But even I know
he only shows up in moments
of the greatest need.

And so I sleep and I live,
I laugh and I love,
sometimes I cry, but mostly,
I am getting a hang of this madness
we tend to call the life.
And with every victory I know
my chances of seeing him again
thin. Significantly.

I saw him tonight.
This morning…
In the moment
right before you wake up for the new day.
It was dark,
and the whole world might have been sleeping still.
But I felt alive
and my entire body
vibrated with dark inspiration.

And so I must
write write write
before he disappears again,
and leaves behind
nothing.
A colorless void
of no taste no smell no thoughts
where even darkness
seems like a good company.

She woke up in the middle of the night and googled the five stages of grief. It has never occurred to her how much being laid off from a spot which caused her so much trouble and frustration will affect her.
She has always been good at noticing the little stuff, the small temporary perfections which made her life feel so special. Yet she’d somehow missed how many of these were connected to her being good at her job, being able to come to the office and see all the imperfectly beautiful and human people there, and being part of whatever it was they worked together for.
She trusted the Universe’s timing with all that she had, but it didn’t mean she liked it.
She felt like a ghost mourning her own departure.

It’s the last night on Earth.
The last remaining light of the stars went out,
the last tones of the all encompassing music
dissipated.
There’s nowhere to dance, nowhere to hide,
no words to say…
There’s you,
and me,
and the scary void
awaiting our final goodbyes.

It’s the last night on Earth.
It felt like there was always going to be more time,
yet there was nowhere
to move anyway.
There were no kisses to give, no promises to keep,
nothing but kindness and light
in the eyes of a stranger.
My familiar stranger.

It’s the last night on Earth
and I wonder sometimes -
how one stays hopeful
for the new universe
being born in front of our own eyes,
when the old one has to vanish first.
Full of memories, full of sweetness,
full of… you.

It’s the last night on Earth.
And I will miss you dearly.
